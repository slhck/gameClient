Documentation of Xvid
=====================

INSTALL
-------

This file describes the steps to build and install Xvid on supported
platforms.

NOTE FOR MacOS X PLATFORM
-------------------------

Many versions of yasm/nasm are known to be buggy for Mach-O output,
whereas nasm seems to be less reliable than yasm. Therefore, yasm
is highly recommended for Mac OS X target.

* yasm 1.0 or later is required to build xvidcore. *
